# 🚀 Arduino Basics Workshop  

Welcome to the **Arduino Basics Workshop Repository**!  
This workshop was hosted by **The Robotics Society of PEC** to introduce freshers to the world of microcontrollers, sensors, and hands-on electronics.  

## 📌 About the Workshop  
The aim of this session was to give beginners a strong foundation in programming Arduino boards and interfacing common electronic components.  

Participants got a chance to:  
- Write their first Arduino programs  
- Learn how to control hardware with simple code  
- Explore real-world applications of sensors and actuators
